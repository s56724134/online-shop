## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system:
- **Windows & macOS**  
    - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)  
    - Docker Compose is included in Docker Desktop, no additional installation is needed.

- **Linux**  
    - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)  
    - If Docker Compose is not included, install it manually:  

      ```sh
      sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y  # Ubuntu/Debian
      ```
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/s56724134/online-shop.git
cd online-shop
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Build and start the project**
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify that the services are running**
Check the running containers:
```sh
docker ps
```
If everything is working properly, you should see output similar to this:
```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           STATUS         PORTS                   NAMES
123456789abc   barney_flask    Up 10 minutes  0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp  flask-app
987654321xyz   mysql:latest    Up 10 minutes  3306/tcp                mysql
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Access the application**
Once you have the flask container ID, use the following command to enter the container:
```sh
# Please replace <flask-container-id> with the actual Flask container ID. You can find the ID by running `docker ps`.
docker exec -it <flask-container-id> bash
```
Once inside the container, you should see a prompt like:
```sh
root@221e419488c9:/app# 
```
Now, you can run the application by executing:
```sh
python main.py
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Stop the application**
To stop all running containers:
```sh
docker-compose down
```
